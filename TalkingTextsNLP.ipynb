Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\\n\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well\\nto follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\\nthe tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.

I only\\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\\na face that a man might die for.\\n\\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if\\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.’\\n\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a\\ncab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby\\nfare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.\\nMonica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\nminutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\n\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others\\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\n\\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\\n\\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\\n\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in\\nthe secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\\nthat started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some\\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\\nmean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”'), (['Arnsworth Castle', 'chin'], '“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\\nshe half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”'), (['Sherlock Holmes', 'Holmes'], '“Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.”'), (['John', 'Sherlock Holmes', 'Holmes'], '“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took\\n    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\\n    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\\n    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\\n    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\\n    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\\n    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\n    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\\n    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\\n    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\\n    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\\n    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\\n    down just as you departed.\\n\\n    “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\n    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\\n    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\\n    the Temple to see my husband.\\n\\n    “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\n    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\\n    call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\\n    peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do\\n    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\\n    wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\\n    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\n    take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\\n    possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n\\n\\n    “Very truly yours,\\n\\n    “IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.”'), (['Miss', 'Mary Sutherland', 'Sutherland', 'Mary'], '“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life\\nitself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\nimagination.”')]\n"

        " We refined the character interaction data by filtering out instances where characters were speaking to themselves (self-speaking interactions). After this, we formatted the interaction data into a Pandas DataFrame to visualize and analyze the frequency with which characters in Tom Sawyer speak to each other. This allowed us to present a table of interactions that captures meaningful exchanges between characters, and we saved the results into a CSV file for reporting. Together, these steps provided a complete picture of character interactions based on dialogues and grammatical structures in the text.\n",

        "Working on this assignment was a deeply engaging and nostalgic experience. Having read *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer* and *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* during our childhood, it was an absolute delight to revisit these classic novels, but now through a completely new lens — that of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The ability to analyze the interactions, dialogues, and intricate details of characters through machine learning and text processing gave us a fresh perspective on these timeless stories. By applying various NLP techniques, we uncovered patterns in how characters communicate and interact, and this exercise was both intellectually rewarding and personally enjoyable.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, while the process was insightful, there are certain limitations that became evident, particularly with the test set. The *Tom Sawyer* text posed challenges in terms of accurately identifying and mapping character interactions. Many character names appeared in varying forms (e.g., *Huck* vs. *Huckleberry Finn*) and required extensive manual mapping, which could potentially miss subtle variations. Additionally, irrelevant entities like \"Project Gutenberg\" and other non-character entities were detected as characters, even after multiple rounds of filtering. This not only diluted the frequency counts but also introduced unnecessary noise into the final results.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we had more time, we would focus on refining the system in several key areas:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Better Character Recognition**: We would improve the handling of variations in character names. Instead of relying solely on manual mapping, we could implement a more automated clustering algorithm or utilize co-reference resolution techniques to group similar entities together. This would minimize errors in character identification and ensure better accuracy in interaction tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Enhancing Quote Detection**: While our approach to extracting dialogues worked well for some parts of the text, it could be further improved by adding more sophisticated quote detection algorithms that account for multi-line or complex dialogues. This would capture more nuanced interactions that were potentially missed by the current regular expression-based approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Improving Contextual Understanding**: We could improve the dependency parsing component by adding contextual cues (e.g., identifying indirect speech or passive voice interactions) to capture more complex relationships between characters. This would allow for more accurate speaker-listener pairing, particularly in sentences where the dialogue is not explicitly framed with traditional reporting verbs like \"said\" or \"asked.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cleaner Entity Filtering**: Although we filtered out many irrelevant entities, there were still instances of unwanted entries like \"Theirs\" and \"Groan so\" in the final output. By refining our exclusion lists and integrating semantic understanding, we could further eliminate these outliers to produce cleaner, more accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sentiment Analysis of Dialogues**: Adding a sentiment analysis layer to dialogues could provide deeper insights into the emotional tone of character interactions, giving a richer understanding of relationships between characters (e.g., positive vs. negative exchanges). This would add a new dimension to the character interactions analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, while our current system successfully identified and tracked interactions between characters, these refinements would make the system more robust and accurate, especially when applied to diverse texts with different styles of narration and dialogue structure. Given more time, implementing these improvements would make the analysis not only more accurate but also more insightful, offering a deeper understanding of character dynamics in literary works."
